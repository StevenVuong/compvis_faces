# Compvis_playground
Incorporate different aspects of computer vision and deep learning, with (improving) engineering practices to learn and showcase as a computer vision repository

#### Current Idea:
-  Take input feed of video data
-  Recognise faces from that video data (face recognition)
-  Then zoom into face pixel
-  Increase Resolution:
    -  https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN
    -  GAN? https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix
    -  https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution 
-  Face sentiment analysis

SideGoal:

-  Visualise Heat Map of a CNN
    -  https://github.com/idealo/cnn-exposed
    -  `/code_samples/sophie_vis_activation_snippet.py`
-  Fast Style Transfer: https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer
-  Have Separate folder structure for each idea; perhaps they can link in. And feed into/out of a data folder with download instructions (to put into a bash script?)
