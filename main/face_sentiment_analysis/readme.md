# Face Emotion Analysis!

This is a supervised learning task to classify faces into 6 emotions:
-  Anger
-  Disgust
-  Fear
-  Happy
-  Sad
-  Surprise
-  Neutral

So we will try to build a UNet with Skip connections to achieve this; and show
activation heat map layers in order to achieve this task.
